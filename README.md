Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the project code and documentation files for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

## Files

The code assumes that the data consumed by the R program is not modified in any shape or form.

The `CodeBook.md` file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

The `run_analysis.R` script basically contains all the code as required by the assignment It contains 3 functions that should match all the criteria for the assignment. The script also contains extensive documentation about each function and how they can be called.

The output for the 5th step of the assignment is written out in a file called `averages.txt`. The third function in the R script does that.
